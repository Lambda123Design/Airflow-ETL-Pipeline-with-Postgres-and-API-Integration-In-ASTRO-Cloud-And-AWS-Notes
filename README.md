# **A) Introduction To ETL Pipeline**

Hello guys! So welcome to this new amazing module of understanding and developing ETL pipelines using Airflow. In this video and in the upcoming series of videos, we are going to understand about ETL pipelines, and we are also going to develop an end-to-end project, which will be super important for data scientists or big data engineers.

Okay, so before I go ahead, I really want to make you understand about what exactly is ETL pipelines. So whenever we talk about ETL pipelines, there are three key terms. ETL — the first term that we have is something called as extract. The second term is something called as transform. And the third term is something called as load. So why this extract, transform, load needs to be developed in a form of pipeline and where exactly it is used, I’ll be talking more about it.

So let’s consider that here I have a specific project. This is my entire life cycle of a data science project or big data engineering team. Here you will be able to see that let’s say this is my data science project. Or it can also be a data engineering project. It can be different projects. Now initially when this specific project comes, the first step which we have already discussed is about requirement gathering.

Now whenever we talk about requirement gathering, obviously domain expert or product owner will definitely discuss with the business analyst and they will jot down all the requirements that are required in order to solve this particular project. They usually try to follow an agile process. In the agile process, they usually divide all the stories in the form of sprints. So in sprint one let’s say there are some stories. In sprint two, they may probably solve some stories. Continuous integration, continuous development, and continuous deployment will specifically happen.

So in this process, once the requirement is jotted down, then what happens is that the requirement is basically sent to the data scientist or data analyst team. Now this team, along with the domain expert and product owner, will first of all try to find out from where they really need to get the data in order to solve this project. The data may be present in internal databases or it may be present in third-party APIs.

Now once they identify what data is required to solve the problem, then they give this particular task to the big data engineering team, wherein the engineering team will probably go ahead and create the entire data pipeline. Because this is the source of the data, and without a data pipeline, I cannot accumulate all the data in one place. So what this data pipeline will basically do is follow a process. In the big data engineering team, they specifically go ahead and follow this ETL pipeline process.

Now this ETL pipeline is a part of the data pipeline. Once we talk about this ETL pipeline, what exactly is it? Usually once we identify where our data source is, the first step is to extract. This is my source from where I really need to take the data to solve my problem statement. This source, as I said, can be APIs, it can be internal databases, it can be IoT devices. The data may be coming from IoT devices. It can be various sources. And when I say APIs, it may also be a paid API itself.

Now let’s say for a specific problem statement I am having 4 to 5 sources of data. What a data engineering person will basically do is create something called a data pipeline. In this data pipeline, the main task is to integrate or combine all these data sources together, then do some kind of pre-processing or transformation. This pre-processing can involve combining all this data coming from different sources.

In the pre-processing and data transformation stage, what a data engineer or even a data scientist can do is combine all this data and then try to convert it into a JSON format, which will have the entire data together. This part, where we are taking all the data from the source, is basically extract. The second stage is transform, because I need to do some kind of cleaning of this data and then convert it into a format. Why specifically convert into JSON or any other format? The reason is simple — all this combined data will be stored in one specific source. Going ahead, the data scientist will be dependent on this source only, not on so many sources.

The final step is load. We take this JSON and store it in some kind of source. That source can be a SQL server, MongoDB database, or Postgres. Whatever database you want to use, whether you store it in SQL or NoSQL form, JSON or relational, it is up to you. This will be your final source. What the data scientist will do is depend only on this source, because all the data is combined and stored there. That is why we call this ETL: extract, transform, and load.

Usually in this ETL process, we also call it data pipelines, because ETL is nothing but collecting data from various sources, combining them, and finally loading into a specific source. So this is all about the ETL pipeline.

Now the best part is that since we are learning Airflow, Airflow is an amazing open-source platform that will help you create these amazing data pipelines, which include extract, transform, and load. In our project, we will take an API, read the data from the API (this will be the source), perform some transformation (take specific fields and convert them into JSON), and finally save it in a database. The database we will use is PostgreSQL.

Why use Airflow? Because this process needs to be scheduled. For example, if my problem statement requires new data every week or every day, I need to schedule this. To schedule in this way, we use Airflow. So this is the problem statement I am going to take, and I’ll start implementing it in the next video.

I hope you got an idea about what exactly is an ETL pipeline and how Airflow helps, because we will be able to schedule the entire process, set when you want to run it, how many times per week, etc. The best part is that PostgreSQL and all will run in a Docker container so that it will be independent — wherever you deploy, it should automatically work.

So yes, this was it from my side. I will see you all in the next video. Thank you.

# **Notes:**

1. Introduction to the Module:

In this module, we focus on understanding and developing ETL pipelines using Airflow. ETL pipelines are a fundamental part of data engineering and data science workflows, and through this series, we will also build an end-to-end project. Such a project is highly important for both data scientists and big data engineers, as it involves automating the process of moving data from sources, transforming it into usable formats, and loading it into storage systems.

2. What is ETL?

ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. These three terms define the core steps of data pipeline development. The extract step involves pulling data from various sources, the transform step deals with cleaning and processing the data into usable formats, and the load step saves the processed data into target databases or storage systems. Together, these steps form a pipeline that ensures data is consistently prepared for downstream use.

3. Project Lifecycle and Requirement Gathering:

Every project begins with requirement gathering, where the domain experts or product owners work with business analysts to collect all necessary requirements. These requirements are generally structured using agile methodologies, split into smaller stories, and executed in sprints. After the requirements are finalized, they are passed on to the data science and analytics teams, who identify the sources of data needed to solve the problem. Data may come from internal databases, third-party APIs, or even IoT devices.

4. Role of the Big Data Engineering Team:

Once the sources are identified, the responsibility of creating the pipeline falls on the big data engineering team. Their task is to build a robust data pipeline that can collect, clean, and combine data from multiple sources into a single, reliable format. This ensures that data scientists or analysts do not need to deal with scattered raw data, but instead rely on a single, structured source for their work.

5. Extract Stage:

The extract stage is the first step of the ETL process. Here, data is collected from the defined sources, which may include APIs, databases, or IoT devices. In many cases, there may be multiple sources, sometimes four or five different APIs or data streams. The goal is to pull all relevant raw data into the pipeline.

6. Transform Stage:

The transform stage involves cleaning, pre-processing, and combining the extracted data. This may include handling missing values, merging datasets, or converting them into a common format such as JSON. Transforming data into JSON or another structured format makes it easier to store and ensures consistency for downstream tasks. By transforming and combining the data, the engineering team prepares it in a way that the data scientist only needs to work with this unified source instead of juggling multiple raw inputs.

7. Load Stage:

The load stage is the final step of the pipeline, where the processed data is stored in a target system. This could be a SQL database such as PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or MySQL, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB. The choice depends on the project requirements, but the essential point is that all the data is consistently stored in one place. From this stage onward, the data scientist or analyst depends only on this clean source.

8. Airflow for Scheduling and Automation:

Airflow is introduced as an open-source orchestration platform that automates the ETL pipeline. It allows scheduling, monitoring, and managing workflows efficiently. For example, if a project requires new data to be ingested every day or every week, Airflow can schedule these runs automatically without manual intervention. This ensures consistency, repeatability, and scalability of data pipelines.

9. Our Project Setup:

In the project we will build, the source will be an API. We will extract data from this API, perform transformations such as selecting specific fields and converting the data into JSON, and finally load it into a PostgreSQL database. To ensure portability and ease of deployment, PostgreSQL and Airflow will both run in Docker containers, which makes the solution independent of the environment and ready to deploy anywhere.

10. Conclusion:

The ETL process is essential in data projects because it centralizes data collection, transformation, and storage, making it reliable for downstream analysis. Airflow enhances this by providing automation and scheduling capabilities. With the help of Airflow and Docker, the entire ETL process becomes automated, scalable, and portable, ensuring smooth execution in real-world projects.
